## ⚡ How It Works

- **No installation needed** - just HTML + JavaScript
- **No server needed** - runs entirely in browser
- **Data resets** when you refresh the page
- **Perfect for testing** UI and clicking through features

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

**Problem**: File won't open
**Solution**: Make sure you're opening `standalone.html`, not other files

**Problem**: Looks weird
**Solution**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)

**Problem**: Data disappeared
**Solution**: That's normal - it resets on page refresh (it's just a test!)
